You are not the first.

Someone or something must have been here before you. Their technology seems more advanced than that around you, but you think you might be able to figure it out, if only you could find enough of the glyphs to make sense of it all.

Welcome

Welcome to Underground Domes, this is a Minecraft mod that started out as an idea to introduce myself to modding; it has however inspired me to create something far greater than just an introduction to modding.
I intend to create a mod that works standalone, but is balanced when played together with the mods featured in the Feed The Beast technical modpacks.
The emphasis will be on end-game gameplay, you will not be able to use the full potential of the Domes until you have visited enough of the spheres.

Features:
* The spheres will be remaniscent of a space centre or moon base, each sphere will have a purpose.
* An energy system based on Light
* Power cables will double up as lights.
